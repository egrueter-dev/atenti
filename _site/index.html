        If you are reading this, chances are you are an entrepreneur with a software development agency.
    </p>
    <p>
        You might be concerned about how you will continue to grow in this economic environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Will your clients stay with you during this economic downturn?
    </p>
    <p>
        Will freelancing platforms continue to bear fruit in the years ahead, with thousands of newly unemployed people
        piling on to them?
    </p>
        How can you <b>de-risk your business</b> and ensure you <b>stand out</b> in a crowded market with <b>too much competition?</b>
    <p>
        One thing we can be sure of right now is this: <b>Average is dead.</b>
    <p>
    <p>
        There are now so many average developers and development agencies swamping the market.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clients with capital have <b>plenty of choices.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to survive, you need to:
    </p>

        <ul>
            <li> Stand out in your team and value proposition </li>
            <li> Stand on your networks and grow them </li>
            <li> Deploy systems to share your value with more clients </li>
            <li> Leverage Blockbuster Partnerships to get new business </li>
            <li> Own a proven sales process you can rely on to grow predictably </li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Our <b>Step by Step</b> Agency Ignition Program takes your business from struggling to find new client work to an abundance
        of new partnerships and new business.

    Thanks for visiting the site, \n
    Erik G here. I am the founder of Agency Ignition. \n
    If you are poking around my site, it means you are probably interested in how this site was built. \n
    I'll save you the time. I hand coded this out of HTML/CSS/JS with no frameworks or libraries. \n
    \n
    Why? Because I care about performance for you. I don't want you to navigate through another shitty, chuggy website. \n
    I want the code clean and I want you to have a great experience.\n
    \n
    It's the same care I put into the product I am offering here. If you want to grow your business let's work together\n
