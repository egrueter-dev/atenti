        If you are reading this, chances are you are an entrepreneur with a software development agency.
    </p>
    <p>
        You might be concerned about how you will continue to grow in this economic environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Will your clients stay with you during this economic downturn?
    </p>
    <p>
        Will freelancing platforms continue to bear fruit in the years ahead, with thousands of newly unemployed people
        piling on to them?
    </p>
        How can you <b>de-risk your business</b> and ensure you <b>stand out</b> in a crowded market with <b>too much competition?</b>
    <p>
        One thing we can be sure of right now is this: <b class="yellow-ul">Average is dead.</b>
    <p>
    <p>
        There are now so many average developers and development agencies swamping the market.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clients with capital have <b>plenty of choices.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to survive, you need to:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Stand out in your team and value proposition </li>
            <li> Stand on your networks and grow them </li>
            <li> Deploy systems to share your value with more clients </li>
            <li> Leverage partnerships to get new business </li>
            <li> Own a proven sales process you can rely on to grow predictably </li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Our <b>Step by Step</b> Agency Ignition Program shows you how to sustainably own and grow your sales and
        partnerships:
        
        <ul>
            <li> We give you a proven process you can follow </li>
            <li> We give you access to our network </li>
            <li> We work with you hands on to ensure your success </li>
            <li> We guarantee you'll see results, or your money back </li>
        </ul>
    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Our team of sales consultants takes you through the process</b> 
        and trains you to run your business like a sales machine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because we are maniacally focused on client results, <b class="yellow-ul">our team only takes 5 agencies into each batch. This is not negotiable.</b>
        If you are not selected for this batch, we will notify you when the next batch opens.

    Thanks for visiting the site, \n
    Erik G here. I am the founder of Agency Ignition. \n
    If you are poking around my site, it means you are probably interested in how this site was built. \n
    I'll save you the time. I hand coded this out of HTML/CSS/JS with no frameworks or libraries. \n
    \n
    Why? Because I care about performance for you. I don't want you to navigate through another shitty, chuggy website. \n
    I want the code clean and I want you to have a great experience.\n
    \n
    It's the same care I put into the product I am offering here. If you want to grow your business let's work together\n
    erik@devshopignition.com \n
