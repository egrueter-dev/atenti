        <b>What is in this program exactly?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Because I can, my friend.

    <p>
        <b>** Why are you using emojis?</b>

    <p>
        Because I can, my friend.

    <p>
        <b>How do I know this will work?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Can you chart out a growth path for me?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Why should I trust you and believe in you?
         </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        look at the results.

            Does this method involve email spam, Linkedin spam, or other unethical sales practices?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        No, it does not. You are going to have to communicate with folks who you do not necessarily know via email and set up sales meetings. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>If you are going to look at my business, how do I know you won‚Äôt steal my clients, and run away laughing?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Before every engagement, we sign an air-tight NDA and contract with you so that your clients are safely yours.
        Our team is not interested in getting into the software development business. We are building an information product business.

    Thanks for visiting the site, \n
    Erik G here. I am the founder of Agency Ignition. \n
    If you are poking around my site, it means you are probably interested in how this site was built. \n
    I'll save you the time. I hand coded this out of HTML/CSS/JS with no frameworks or libraries. \n
    \n
    Why? Because I care about performance for you. I don't want you to navigate through another shitty, chuggy website. \n
    I want the code clean and I want you to have a great experience.\n
    \n
    It's the same care I put into the product I am offering here. If you want to grow your business let's work together\n
    erik@devshopignition.com \n
