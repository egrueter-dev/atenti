    </p>
    <p>
        You might be concerned about how you will continue to grow in this economic environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Will your clients stay with you during this economic downturn?
    </p>
    <p>
        Will freelancing platforms continue to bear fruit in the years ahead, with thousands of newly unemployed people
        piling on to them?
    </p>
        How can you <b>de-risk your business</b> and ensure you <b>stand out</b> in a crowded market with <b>too much competition?</b>
    <p>
        One thing we can be sure of right now is this: <b class="yellow-ul">Average is dead.</b>
    <p>
    <p>
        There are now so many average developers and development agencies swamping the market.
