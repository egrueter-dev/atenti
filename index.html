        If you are reading this, chances are you are an entrepreneur with a software development agency.
    </p>
    <p>
        You might be concerned about how you will continue to grow in this economic environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Will your clients stay with you during this economic downturn?
    </p>
    <p>
        Will freelancing platforms continue to bear fruit in the years ahead, with thousands of newly unemployed people
        piling on to them?
    </p>
        How can you <b>de-risk your business</b> and ensure you <b>stand out</b> in a crowded market with <b>too much competition?</b>
    <p>
        One thing we can be sure of right now is this: <b>Average is dead.</b>
    <p>
    <p>
        There are now so many average developers and development agencies swamping the market.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clients with capital have <b>plenty of choices.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to survive, you need to:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Stand out in your team and value proposition </li>
            <li> Stand on your networks and grow them </li>
            <li> Deploy systems to share your value with more clients </li>
            <li> Leverage Blockbuster Partnerships to get new business </li>
            <li> Own a proven sales process you can rely on to grow predictably </li>
        </ul>
